# JavaScript-Quiz

## A JavaScript Quiz application that tests the users knowledge on the computing language

## Description 
- The key motivator driving the developement of this application was to provide access to a timed JS quiz so that users can grab their high scores and gauge their progress in the subject compared to their peers.

- This application features a straightforward JavaScript quiz consisting of four questions. The quiz is timed, giving users a total of 60 seconds to complete it. However, there's a catch: every incorrect answer results in a deduction of 10 seconds from the timer. At the end of the quiz, scores will be calculated and displayed. Furthermore, the scores will be saved to a leaderboard, allowing users to compare their performance with their peers. Are you ready to put your JavaScript knowledge to the test?

- This application is a showcase of my developing skills, highlighting the integration of web technologies. The foundation of the webpage is built using HTML and CSS, creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. The core functionality, including the quiz mechanics and interactivity, is driven by JavaScript, demonstrating the synergy of front-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

- As i was building this webpage I was able to apply my current knowledge of localstorage, while also expanding it
